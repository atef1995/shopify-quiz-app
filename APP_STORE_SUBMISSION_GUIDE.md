## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: URL Configuration Issue

**CURRENT PROBLEM:** Partner Dashboard still shows old URL `https://shopify-quiz-app.fly.dev/auth/login`

**ROOT CAUSE:** 
- Your `shopify.app.toml` has the correct URLs (`product-quiz-builder.fly.dev`)
- But Partner Dashboard wasn't updated when you renamed the app
- Both Fly.io apps exist but are suspended

**SOLUTION - Option 1 (Recommended): Sync with npm run deploy**

```bash
# This will update Partner Dashboard with URLs from shopify.app.toml
npm run deploy
```

**SOLUTION - Option 2: Manual Update in Partner Dashboard**

If `npm run deploy` doesn't update the URLs:

1. Go to: https://partners.shopify.com
2. Navigate to: Apps ‚Üí Product Quiz Builder ‚Üí Configuration
3. Find "App URL" field
4. Change from: `https://shopify-quiz-app.fly.dev`
5. Change to: `https://product-quiz-builder.fly.dev`
6. Update "Allowed redirection URL(s)":
   - Remove: `https://shopify-quiz-app.fly.dev/auth/login`
   - Add: `https://product-quiz-builder.fly.dev/auth/login`
   - Keep: `https://product-quiz-builder.fly.dev/auth/callback`
   - Keep: `https://product-quiz-builder.fly.dev/api/auth`
7. Click "Save" at the top right

**SOLUTION - Option 3: Resume the correct Fly.io app**

```bash
# Resume the new app (product-quiz-builder)
flyctl apps resume product-quiz-builder

# Resume the database
flyctl apps resume shopify-quiz-db
```

**Then verify:**
1. Visit: https://product-quiz-builder.fly.dev
2. Should show app (not suspended message)

**What This Checks:**
- App redirects to OAuth immediately after merchant clicks "Install"
- Uses Shopify CLI authentication flow
- No manual steps required

**Our Implementation:**
- `app/routes/auth.$.tsx` handles OAuth flow
- `authenticate.admin()` used in all admin routes
- Auto-redirects to `/app` after successful auth

**How It Works:**
1. Merchant clicks "Install App"
2. Redirected to Shopify OAuth consent screen
3. Merchant approves permissions
4. Redirected to `/auth/callback`
5. Session created, redirected to `/app` (quiz list)

**Verification:**

- No loading screens that hang
- UI is functional and ready to use

**Our Implementation:**

uri = "/webhooks/customers/data_request"

[[webhooks.subscriptions]]
topics = ["customers/redact"]
uri = "/webhooks/customers/redact"

[[webhooks.subscriptions]]
topics = ["shop/redact"]
uri = "/webhooks/shop/redact"
```

**Webhook Handlers:**
- `app/routes/webhooks.customers.data_request.tsx` - Exports quiz data for customer email
- `app/routes/webhooks.customers.redact.tsx` - Deletes quiz results for customer
- `app/routes/webhooks.shop.redact.tsx` - Deletes ALL shop data on uninstall

**What They Do:**
1. **Data Request:** Finds all quiz results for customer email, returns JSON export
2. **Customer Redact:** Deletes quiz results where email matches
3. **Shop Redact:** Cascade deletes: Quizzes ‚Üí Questions ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Analytics ‚Üí Subscriptions ‚Üí Sessions

**Status:** SHOULD PASS (Handled by Shopify SDK)

**What This Checks:**
- App verifies webhook requests are actually from Shopify
- Uses HMAC-SHA256 signature validation
- Prevents spoofed webhook attacks

**Our Implementation:**

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// app/routes/webhooks.customers.data_request.tsx
export const action = async ({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) => {
  const { shop, payload } = await authenticate.webhook(request);
  // ‚Üë This line validates HMAC signature automatically
  // If invalid, throws error and returns 401
}
```

**Verification:**
